<P>HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one Bitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. HTML is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the WC3, the organization charged with designing and maintaining the language.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="courier"><H2>Okay, but what does H-T-M-L stand for?</H2> <P><B>Hyper</B> is the opposite of linear. In the good old days - when a mouse was something the cat chased - computer programs ran linearly: when the program had executed one action it went to the next line and after that, the next line and so on.<BR><B>Text</B> is self-explanatory.<BR><B>Mark-up</B> is what you do with the text. You are marking up the text the same way you do in a text editing program with headings, bullets and bold text and so on. <BR><B>Language</B> is what HTML is. It uses many English words. </FONT></P>
